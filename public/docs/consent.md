### 6. Confidentiality and Anonymity
Your participation in this study will be anonymous. We will **not** collect any directly identifying information, such as your name, email address, or IP address. While we collect general demographic information (age range, device type), this study **does not collect sensitive personal data** as defined by GDPR or the Swedish Ethical Review Act (e.g., data on health, ethnic origin, political opinions, etc.). A unique, randomly generated participant ID will be assigned to your responses, which cannot be linked back to you personally.

All data collected will be stored securely on password-protected servers. Only the research team members listed above will have access to the raw data. The results of this study may be used in reports, presentations, or publications, but any reported data will be presented in aggregate form (group averages), ensuring individual responses cannot be identified. The data collected will be used solely for the academic purposes of this research project and will **not be used for commercial purposes**. Data will be kept for maximum 5 years after study completion according to university policy and then securely destroyed.
